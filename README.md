# Data Scienctist with AI/ML Proficiency


### ABOUT ME
I am passionate about turning complex data into actionable insights using data science and AI/ML techniques. I have hands-on experience in data analytics, predictive modeling, workflow automation, and scalable data processing, with proficiency in Python, SQL, AWS, and Hadoop. I specialize in building ML-ready datasets, feature engineering pipelines, and performing exploratory data analysis to deliver explainable, reproducible AI/ML solutions that solve real-world problems.

I believe in the power of generosity: giving selflessly to help others grow while building yourself in the process. As I like to say, *“The more you give, the more you rise—both for others and for yourself.”*
